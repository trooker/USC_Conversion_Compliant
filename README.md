# USC_Conversion_Compliant
This project describes the conversion of a standard HK USC 45ACP to a compliant UPM format.  When the term compliant is used that means compliance with Federal Firearms (ATF) Regulations in effect at the time of construction, 2013. 

This conversion is one of many that have been executed by various owners/individuals.  To see the results of various other projects which various other owners have attempted/complete see https://www.gunbroker.com/All/search?Keywords=HK%20USC%20to%20UMP


USC to UMP Conversion Must:
1> Safety
1.1> Clear the weapon before attempting any conversion.
1.2> Consult the owners manual for safety, operation, and disassembly into major groups.
1.3> Wear proper eye protection.
1.4> Recommendation: When not on the range remove the bolt and operating spring to render the UCS/UMP no-operational.  

2> You need to know the Federal, State, and Local jurisdictional rules and laws related to your fire arms. We will not help you   with bail, lawyer fees, or court cost. You are on your own.

3> The original USC has now been in service in the UMP since 2013.  Over 2,000 rounds have been fired down range without an incident.  Although the large capacity magazines of the UMP format have been used often at the indoor firing range, the smaller USC magazines were found to be better suited for the purposes of hunting.  The smaller USC are lighter and have a smaller footpring extending from the bottom the carbine.
