1> USC to UMP Conversion Must:
    1.1> Safety
       1.1.1> Clear the weapon before attempting any conversion.
    1.1.2> Consult the owners manual for safety, operation, and disassembly into major groups.
    1.1.3> Wear proper eye protection.
    1.1.4> Recommendation: When not on the range remove the bolt and operating spring to render the UCS/UMP no-operational.

3> The original USC has now been in service in the UMP since 2013.  Over 2,000 rounds have been fired down range without an incident.  Although the large capacity magazines of the UMP format have been used often at the indoor firing range, the smaller USC magazines were found to be better suited for the purposes of hunting.  The smaller USC are lighter and have a smaller footpring extending from the bottom the carbine.
